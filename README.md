### Who dis?
Hi!! I was born in 2008, as of writing this I'm 15 years old.  
I know how to program in:
- Python
- HTML / CSS / Javascript
- C# (with UnityEngine)
- Currently learning Rust!


### You disappeared???
I'm probably working on school =w=  
I mostly do this in *my free time*, it's just a hobby. This is lower priority than other important things.


### Cool looking numbers :P

This one is probably a bit off since sometimes the GitIgnore doesn't like to play nice with UnityEngine.  
I don't actually code in HLSL or ShaderLab, but those were commited alongside my scripts...
