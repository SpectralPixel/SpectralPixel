### Who dis?
Hi!! I was born in 2008, as of writing this I'm 15 years old. Coding since late 2019, when I was 11.


### I know how to program in:
- Python
  - Tkinter GUI 
- HTML / CSS / Javascript
- C# (with UnityEngine)
- Beginner in Rust, finished the book.
- Learning the Bevy game engine.
- Scratch (don't know if that counts though XD)


### Setup?
- Dual booting:
  - Arch Linux (since January 2024)
  - Windows 11
- My code editor is VSCode, thinking about switching to a modal editor like helix though...
- Laptop


### You disappeared???
- I'm probably working on school =w=
- I mostly do this in *my free time*, it's just a hobby. This is lower priority than other important things.
- If you really, *really* need to reach me, mail me at `encrypteddvjjrxv@gmail.com` or `encrypteddvjjrxv` on Discord.  


### Watcha up to?
- Check my GitHub repositories to see what I'm working on!
- I archive all the repositories that I finished working on, I don't like leaving stuff on hold for a long time.
- If you want to work together with me, feel free to hit me up! I'm probably not up to anything special...
- Currently, none of my projects have any monetary incentives, I just code for fun
